# Task.It

<b>A service provider app for earning money</b>

<h2>Idea of the App:</h2>

There are two different users for the app using the app on the same platform, the employee and the employer:

Employer: The user goes to the employer section of the app if he/she wants to post a job or task for the users(employees) to look for. He provides an elaborate description of the app including all the specifications that he/she needs for the job to be done. * In the employer section the user can also see all the previous statistics about the previous jobs that the user has posted and also about the completion time and statistics related to it. * The employer will be able to choose among the various applicants for the based on the prices asked by them and their previous ratings.

Employee:  This section of the app is for the users who want to search for a job/task in the app. The user sees a list of all the jobs that are going on currently and also see their respective status. * From the list the user can select the job of their choice and can bid on the job, the employer will then give the job to whoever bids as the amount suitable for the employer.

<h3>Authenticity of the app:</h3>

For the app to be authentic and to ensure the users are not involved in any wrongdoing, and get what they expect from the app, we have developed a two way monetary transaction including a middle-medium which is the application admin, so as soon as the bid gets accepted, the employer pays the money which stays in the app and not gets deposited to the employee, the transaction takes place only when both the employer and the employee check the status of the job as done.

<b>HIGHLIGHTS Bidding System </b>- Bidding System is introduced in order to ensure a healthy competition wages from both ends. Rating System for both employer and employee. Wallet System
